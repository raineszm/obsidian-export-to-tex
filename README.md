## Usage

This plugin allows Obsidian files to exported to TeX format.
When doing so:
- WikiLinks to other files are stripped
- Embeds are resolved
- By default, headings and blocks are associated with labels


### Commands
Export to TeX provides two commands

#### Export to TeX

This command will produce a save as dialog. The contents of the current file will be converted to TeX and saved to that file.

#### Export to Clipboard

The contents of the current file will be converted to TeX and copied to the clipboard.

### Settings

### Generate labels and refs

**Default: true**

By default, Export to TeX will auto generate labels for headings and blocks.
Links to these from within the same file will be converted to `\ref` calls.

### Ref command

**Default: '\cref'**

The command to use for generating refs: defaults to `\cref`.

### Additional math environments

**Default: []**

Export to TeX will by default strip the surrounding displaymath delimeters from toplevel math environments such as `equation`.
If there are other environments you which to do this for, they can be added to this list.

### Default to equation

**Default: false**

By default, display math environments

```
$$
x^2
$$
```
will be exported as display math 
```latex
\[
x^2
\]
```
if there is no top level environment present.

With default to equation on this well instead be exported as
```latex
\begin{equation}
x^2
\end{equation}
```

### Compress Newlines

**Default: false**

When enabled, exported TeX will have any instance of more than one blank line in a row compressed to a single blank line.

### Image path format

**Default: Relative to vault root**

Determines how image paths are written when converting image embeddings `![[image.png]]` to `\includgraphics` calls.
Options are

- *Relative to vault root*: uses to file path relative to the root of the current vault, `\includegraphics{Figures/image.png}`
- *Absolute path*: uses the absolute path to the file on your filesystem, `\includegraphics{/Users/user/Documents/Vault/Figures/image.png}` 
- *File base name*: uses only the base name of the image file: `\includegraphics{image}`
- *Relative to export directory*: gives the file path relative to the export TeX directory, (if copying to clipboard will be relative to default export directory).

### Default export directory

**Defaults to vault root*

If set the file picker will open to the chosen directory for export.
